Steps:
1. insert 4 led's adjacent to each other 
2. connect the the resistor to the shorter(-ve) end of each led
3. connect jumper wires to the longer(+ve) end of each led and then connect them to the gpio pins of rpi
4. insert the second pin of resistor on the out row of breadboard and then connect all of them to the ground pin 9 of the rpi with just 1 cable
5. now run the code
